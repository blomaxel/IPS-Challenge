# IPS-Challenge
This is my attempt to count the number of particle pairs within a distance of <=0.05 (meters) from each other.
The program is written in C.
The makefile uses GNU Compiler Collection (gcc). The command "make" compiles the program and creates an executable called "distanceTest".

Outline of the program:
*Counting the number of particles in 


The three-dimensional particle coordinates are available in the file "positions.xyz".
